# ðŸ’° Loan Approval Prediction App

This is a real-world AI-powered application that predicts whether a loan applicant will be approved, partially approved, or denied based on financial data. It uses an explainable machine learning model (XGBoost + SHAP) and is deployed using Streamlit.

## Features

- Predict loan approval status (100%, 75%, 50%, or denied)
- Dynamic SHAP-based explainability for full transparency
- Engineered smart financial metrics like `EMI`, `Total_Income`, `Income_To_Loan`
- Optimized with `RandomizedSearchCV` for high accuracy
- Built-in Streamlit interface for real-time user interaction

## Model & Tech Stack

- **Algorithm**: XGBoostClassifier (with hyperparameter tuning)
- **Feature Engineering**: EMI, Income Ratios, Total Income
- **Explainability**: SHAP values (summary)
- **Web App**: Streamlit (Multi-page UI)
- **Other Tools**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
